# Finite elment analysis of 3D general frame

In this project, a FEM code is developed in MATLAB for the analysis of the 3D frame. This code is a kind of black box which can work for any 3D frame i.e there is no need to change the MATLAB code every time we change the frame.
The only change has to be made in the input files of the folder.
